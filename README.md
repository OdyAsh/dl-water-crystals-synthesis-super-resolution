# dl-water-crystals-synthesis-super-resolution

A deep learning project where we [surveyed different generative models](https://nbviewer.org/github/OdyAsh/dl-water-crystals-synthesis-super-resolution/blob/main/project_info_2/G4%20-%20Surveying%20Generative%20models%20-%20phase%20II.pdf) and compared diffusion/VAE-GAN models in synthesizing water crystal images.

Comparison results:
